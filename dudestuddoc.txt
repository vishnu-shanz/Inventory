# Student Record Manager Project Documentation

## Overview

The Student Record Manager is a full-stack web application designed to help educational institutions manage student records efficiently. It provides a modern, responsive user interface and robust backend API for CRUD operations, search, filtering, and statistics.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM)
- **Other:** React Query, Vite

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Add, view, edit, and delete student records.
- **Search & Filter:** Find students by name or department.
- **Statistics:** View total students, average GPA, top performers, and active departments.
- **Responsive UI:** Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Validation & Error Handling:** Robust form validation and user feedback.
- **Shared Types:** Consistent data structures across frontend and backend.

---

## How It Works

### Frontend

- Built with React and TypeScript.
- Uses React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design.
- Main dashboard displays stats and a searchable/filterable student table.
- Modals for adding/editing/deleting students.

### Backend

- Express server handles API requests for students and statistics.
- Drizzle ORM manages database schema and queries.
- Shared TypeScript types ensure consistency.
- Error handling and validation for all endpoints.

### Database

- PostgreSQL stores student and user data.
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. **Set up the database:**
   ```
   npm run db:push
   npx tsx scripts/seed-database.ts
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open in browser:**
   Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Mandatory Files to Know

- `package.json`: Scripts and dependencies.
- `shared/schema.ts`: Database schema and shared types.
- `server/index.ts`: Server setup and entry point.
- `server/routes.ts`: API endpoints.
- `client/src/App.tsx`: Main React app.
- `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`: Dashboard page.
- `client/index.html`: Main HTML file for frontend.

## Demo Walkthrough

1. **Dashboard:** Shows student stats and table.
2. **Add Student:** Use the form, see validation.
3. **Edit/Delete Student:** Real-time updates.
4. **Search/Filter:** Quickly find students.
5. **Responsive Design:** Works on all devices.

## What Makes This Project Stand Out

- Full-stack TypeScript for type safety.
- Modern UI/UX with Tailwind CSS.
- Scalable and maintainable code structure.
- Best practices in validation, error handling, and shared types.

---

## How to Extend

- Add authentication/authorization.
- Integrate with a real PostgreSQL instance.
- Add more analytics or reporting features.
- Deploy to cloud platforms.

## Example Explanation to Reviewer

> "This project is a full-stack student management system built with React and Express. It features a modern UI, robust backend API, and type-safe data management. The code is organized for scalability and maintainability, and I followed best practices throughout. I can easily extend it with authentication or more analytics if needed."
